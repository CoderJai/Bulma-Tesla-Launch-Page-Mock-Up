**This is a mock up of a Tesla launch page using BulmaCSS.**

I made a quick mock up of a Tesla launch page using the free BulmaCSS course from Scrimba and BulmaCSS for the UI design. The course link is below. The course was taught by [Zaydek](https://twitter.com/username_zaydek). BulmaCSS was created by [Jeremy Thomas](https://jgthms.com/).

_Technology used:_
[BulmaCSS](https://bulma.io/) for the responsive web design.
[SCRIMBA Course](https://scrimba.com/g/gbulma)to teach me BulmaCSS.
[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) for the web IDE.
